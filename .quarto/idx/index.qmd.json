The course offers an introduction to programming in R and the tidyverse, and a primer on data wrangling and data visualisation.\n\n## **Getting started**\n\nHave a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. While we have have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the next three hours.\n\nIf you are new to R, don't worry - start off with this [deck](http://vivekjason.com/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/installation.html#/title-slide) to learn how to install the software and familiarise yourself with the environment.\n\n## Schedule and Materials\n\n| Date               | Time               | Topic                                                                                                                               |\n|:-------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 14.7.2022 (Monday) | 2.00 pm - 03.00 pm | Introduction to the Tidyverse for [Data wrangling](https://github.com/vivekjason/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/blob/data_wranggling.qmd) |\n|                    | 3.00 pm - 4.00 pm  | [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/vivekjason/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/blob/master/data_viz.qmd) using ggplot2                 |\n|                    | 4.00 pm - 5.00 pm  | Taking a R!de                                                                                                                       |\n|                    | 5.00 pm            | Burning Questions and Wrap-up                                                                                                       |\n\n## Speakers\n\n![](images/1688354405314.png){width=\"2in\"}\n\n**Vivek Jason**\n\nJason is a gazetting Public Health Physician passionate about epidemiology, infectious diseases and data science. He spends his time between coding, parenting a toddler and pondering the fate of the universe.\n\n![](images/1688352291610.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"2in\"}\n\n**Ang Swee Hung**\n\nSwee Hung is a training Public Health Physician from the Institute for Clinical research that works heavily in the fields of non-communicable disease epidemiology. Renowned for her calmness under pressure- Swee Hung also enjoys the serenity of long drives and the excitement of travelling. Her next destination is Shanghai.\n\n**Ng Yit Han**\n\n## **Acknowledgements**\n\nThis course was developed and is maintained by [Vivek Jason](https://github.com/vivekjason), Ang Swee Hung and Ng Yit Han.\n\nThe following individuals have contributed to improving the course or materials have been adapted from their courses: [R for Applied Epidemiology and Public Health](https://epirhandbook.com/en/), [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/), [Roger D.
