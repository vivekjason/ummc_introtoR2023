# **Welcome to An Introduction to R**

Welcome to **An Introduction to R Workshop!** organised by University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia

![](images/intro.png){fig-align="center"}

**What is this workshop?**

This workshop lays the groundwork for addressing key practical aspects of programming needed for the implementation of research methods. The course offers an introduction to programming in R and the tidyverse, and a primer on data wrangling and data visualisation.

## **Getting started**

Have a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. While we have have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the next three hours.

If you are new to R, don't worry - start off with this [deck](http://vivekjason.com/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/installation.html#/title-slide) to learn how to install the software and familiarise yourself with the environment.
